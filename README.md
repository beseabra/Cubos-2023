# Cubos-2023

This project is a web application developed for the company Cubos, aimed at allowing users to search for movies by name or genre. The homepage provides a search field where users can enter their search terms. The application utilizes The Movie DB API to fetch corresponding results and displays up to 5 movies per page with pagination options for navigating through the complete list of results.

The project was built using modern technologies such as React and Next.js, with JavaScript handling the application's logic. Hooks and components were employed to maintain organized and reusable code. Furthermore, the application adheres to recommended practices for semantic HTML, providing a well-defined structure for enhanced accessibility and search engine indexing. The interface is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to ensure a user-friendly experience.
